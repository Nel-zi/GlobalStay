# GlobalStay
 
-- Business Introduction --
GlobalStay Hotels & Resorts is a mid-sized hotel
chain operating across multiple countries. Despite
having well-located and well-maintained properties,
the company has been facing significant challenges
in maintaining occupancy rates and revenue.
Competitors have been outperforming GlobalStay
by adopting more dynamic pricing strategies,
improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing
online visibility.

-- PROBLEM --
GlobalStay is facing challenges in maintaining
competitive pricing and promotional strategies due to
outdated and incomplete market data. The current
manual process of tracking competitor prices and
gathering market intelligence is not only inefficient and
time-consuming but also prone to inaccuracies. The
company urgently needs to obtain actionable insights
into house listings, pricing trends across countries,
listing types, enabling data-driven decisions that
enhance market positioning and profitability.

-- Key Challengesâ€”
Incomplete and outdated market data

Inefficient manual data collection

Lack of real-time insights

Difficulty in analysing data across

multiple countries
